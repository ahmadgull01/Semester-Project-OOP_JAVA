1. Introduction
The SolarSync Society Manager is a Java program that helps simulate how energy is used and billed in a housing society. It uses simple object-oriented programming ideas to create and manage homes, appliances, bills, and users like admins and customers. This project brings Java OOP concepts into real life by showing how they can be used to build a smart and useful system.
2. Objectives
•	To apply core OOP concepts in a real-world Java project.
•	To simulate household electricity management using object modeling.
•	To allow users to view or manage home details using role-based access.
•	To design a modular, scalable system using Java classes and inheritance.
•	To enhance understanding of abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
3. Tools Used
Concepts and Tools	Purpose
Java	Core programming language
Java Swing	GUI creation
IntelliJ IDEA	Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Object-Oriented Design	Project architecture
4. OOP Concepts Used
Classes and Objects:
The project is composed of multiple Java classes, each representing real-world entities like homes, bills, users, and appliances. Objects of these classes are created to perform specific tasks, reflecting real-world modeling.
Inheritance:
Inheritance is used to build a hierarchy of homes. A general home class is extended by specialized types such as Solar Home and Green Solar Home. This allows shared behaviors to be inherited while allowing specialized behavior in subclasses.
Polymorphism:
The project uses polymorphism by defining methods that behave differently depending on the type of object invoking them. This enables the system to handle different types of homes through a common interface, even though each home type may implement its own logic.
Encapsulation:
Each class protects its data by restricting direct access to its internal variables. Accessor and getters and setters methods are provided to control this data safely, promoting data integrity and control.
Abstraction:
Abstract classes and methods are used to provide a base structure that hides unnecessary complexity. Specific implementations are left to derived classes, encouraging a clear separation of concerns and focus on relevant details.
Modularity:
The program is divided into different functional modules (services, models, GUI), making it easier to understand, test, and maintain. Each class handles one responsibility, promoting clean and organized code.
Reusability:
Code is reused across different parts of the system through inheritance and methods. For example, home calculation and billing functionalities can be reused or extended in new home types without rewriting logic from scratch.
5. GUI Working
•	Login Screen: Allows switching between admin and customer.
•	Customer Panel: Enter house ID to view bill.
•	Admin Panel: Can view all homes, edit, delete, and add.
6. Key Features
•	Eco Score calculation
•	Green Meter Visualization
•	Search by owner name
•	Password-protected admin access
•	Use of colored output in console
•	Dynamic appliance assignment
7. Challenges Faced
•	Integrating GUI with backend
•	Aligning Swing components properly
•	Avoiding redundancy in OOP structure
•	Maintaining user-specific logic flow
8. Future Work
•	Add export to PDF for bills
•	Online database integration for cloud backup
•	Mobile app version
•	Email notifications for users
9. Conclusion
This project is a great example of how object-oriented programming (OOP) can be used to build a real-life system for managing energy in homes. By using key OOP ideas like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, the project became well-organized, easy to update, and simple to understand. It clearly shows how Java and OOP can work together to build a smart and clean structure for complex systems.
